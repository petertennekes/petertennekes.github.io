            <div class="card-text"><p>If there is one thing in the agile practises which without a doubt will provide value to your team is retrospectives.
                I try to vary the format based on what the team needs. Is it focused on the day to day way of working or bigger picture direction of the project.</p>
                <p><img width="100px" src="images/Anatomy%20of%20a%20sw%20project%20-%20section.jpg"/>
                    As an example of the big picture format, I present the outcome of a retrospective held at the end of a project.
                    The team was not continuing as a team so the key objective for this retrospective were learnings:
                    what can we learn from this project and how can we share this with unknown future projects</p>

            <div class="card-text"><p>For teams who are dependent on each other in a limeted way, I find working agreements a very simple and powerful way to facilitate good and effective coorperation between the teams</p>
                <p>Working agreements are just that agreements on how to work. It limits the individual team's autonomy but ensures that both teams can work for example on the same code-bas.</p>
                <p>Typical elements in a working agreement are: (part of) the definition of done. Codings standards, design patterns, sprint length and timing, cross team peer review, use of frameworks and libraries, coordination meetings etc </p>
