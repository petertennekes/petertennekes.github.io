            <div class="card-text"><p>If there is one thing in the agile practises which without a doubt will provide value to your team is retrospectives.
                I try to vary the format based on what the team needs. Is it focused on the day to day way of working or bigger picture direction of the project.</p>
                <p><img width="100px" src="images/Anatomy%20of%20a%20sw%20project%20-%20section.jpg"/>
                    As an example of the big picture format, I present the outcome of a retrospective held at the end of a project.
                    The team was not continuing as a team so the key objective for this retrospective were learnings:
                    what can we learn from this project and how can we share this with unknown future projects</p>

            <div class="card-text"><p>For teams who are dependent on each other in a limeted way, I find working agreements a very simple and powerful way to facilitate good and effective coorperation between the teams</p>
                <p>Working agreements are just that agreements on how to work. It limits the individual team's autonomy but ensures that both teams can work for example on the same code-bas.</p>
                <p>Typical elements in a working agreement are: (part of) the definition of done. Codings standards, design patterns, sprint length and timing, cross team peer review, use of frameworks and libraries, coordination meetings etc </p>

            <div class="card-text">Also Agile projects fail and sometimes intervention is necesarray. The way to intervene
                in an agile project is not to fix the problem (quality, timeline, delivery, etc). Well working agile teams are able to improve and fix their own problems.
                In situations where you have to intervene that mechanism is broken. The key to intervene is therefore to fix this mechanism.
